# MultiThreadingSearchProj-6
A multi-threaded C program that solves a word-puzzle. The goal is to ﬁnd and print out all occurrences of meaningful English words with a certain length in a given string of two billion characters long randomly generated by the C program in “randomgen.c” ﬁle.  In order to test a given word and ﬁnd out whether it is meaningful or not, you must perform spell-checking by doing a binary search over the alphabetically sorted list of all English words with their correct spellings. The list is given in the ﬁle “dict.txt”.
